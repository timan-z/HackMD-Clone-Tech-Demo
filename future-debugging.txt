Issue to address later (not the biggest deal yet):

Sometimes at the start of a new line, when you press the tab button (after already typing some text), it won't go the full tab length, it'll do like tab-length - length of already existing characters, if that makes sense.

like it'll go: 123  | when tab usually goes 5 spaces ahead. (here only 2) 


FUTURE REMINDER:
- This code may not be the most efficient.
- I am very much learning about/figuring out Lexical and its intricacies, how it works and stores things, as I go



(ANOTHER BUG I PICKED UP ON RELATED TO THE CODE BUTTON'S FUNCTIONALITY AND PROBABLY THE OTHERS AS WELL):

ADD THIS TO FUTURE-DEBUGGING.TXT:
                - I did find another bug but it's a weird one that might have little to do with what I can fix here?
                So if I take the cursor and place it in the middle of text line like:
                - "some|thing" but then take it off by clicking offscreen, it'll go "something", but then
                if I click the Quote button, I'll get "some> somethingthing" <-- might be a bug I can let slide for now?
                
                ^ like, i may be able to fix this if i just make it so, when you click offscreen, you cursor information all becomes null?
