To do list:
- *Maybe* I should get rid of the line numbers things if it's too complex to make it work with the super lengthy single-line text that goes to a new line (and instead just add a "line counters" thing to the bottom of the Text Editor panel).

Maybe do whole-site theme toggling tonight too since the stuff i targeted to get done has been pretty easy so far... (and if that's easy, I guess I can clean up my code a little bit).
^ eh maybe not

Things I can do at night now:
- Remove the Line numbers effect from the Text Editor (I now want to transition that more to a "line counter" type of thing at the bottom of the Text Editor space (like a bottom horizontal bar at the bottom line of the Text Editor).
- Remove the "Write here" text that appears at the bottom of the Text Editor; it's not supposed to be there, it's supposed to be visible within the Text Editor itself!

- Make it so that the draggable black line inbetween the Text Editor and the Preview Panel "looks nicer" and make it so that -- and this should be done *after* aligning the Text Editor and Preview Panel properly -- the black line only goes from the bottom of the Text Editor/Preview Panel up to the top of it.

- Okay wait, no, I've changed my mind: Reverse the Editor Font bar / Toolbar positions, I want to encase the Toolbar as part of hte Text Editor now (it'll look attached) <-- just like the bar at the bottom of it which I'm planning...
- ^ Look to make the Toolbar *part* of the Text Editor (wrap it up in a <div> with background = transparent)...
^ Like it should be placed inside the editor-container?
