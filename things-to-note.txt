To do list:
- Add a dropdown button that lets you select the colour background for BOTH the text editor AND the render panel (also maybe a dropdown button for changing the text font).

- *Maybe* I should get rid of the line numbers things if it's too complex to make it work with the super lengthy single-line text that goes to a new line (and instead just add a "line counters" thing to the bottom of the Text Editor panel).
