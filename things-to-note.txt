To do list:
- Add a dropdown button that lets you select the colour background for BOTH the text editor AND the render panel (also maybe a dropdown button for changing the text font).

- Need to figure out a way to have the Toolbar be under the "Text Editor" header (I can probably leave this for later).

- I want to move the render panel to be side-by-side with the text editor (have kinda done this already but I want to play with the CSS to make it look proper).
Then I can have a button that makes it full screen for just the render panel.
(You can hide the render panel so that it's just full screen for the Text Editor).
^ want to change it so that it's side-by-side by default (no longer hidden is preview panel -- it's open by default)

- I want to have the "Hide Preview"/"Show Preview" button to be placed better in some way (a better place where it's positioned).

- Noticed another issue where if I begin the text editor with a series of newlines, that will not be recognized in the render panel...
(I don't know if this is big enough of an issue to fix? -- It might be something I just leave in, seems like a weird thing to put the effort
into fixing tbh).
